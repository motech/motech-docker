Firstly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install docker http://docker.io (also be sure to follow the 'Giving non-root 
access' instructions at the end) & install fig http://orchardup.github.io/fig
All commands must be run from the docker directory, that's the one containing 
this README and the *.yml files




Details
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The implementer setup (imp.yml) uses the motech/motech:0.23-SNAPSHOT container
which includes tomcat as well as the motech binaries.
The developer setup (dev.yml) uses the motech/tomcat:7.0.53 container which, in
addition to including tomcat, also shares the container's /root/.motech 
directory with the host's /home/{user}/.motech directory (hence the sed line in
the setup_as_dev.sh script)




Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To setup as an implementer (everything is automagically installed):
./setup_as_imp.sh

To setup as a dev (you just build & all the bits go to the tomcat container):
./setup_as_dev.sh
An additional step is necessary for devs, see below.



Starting MOTECH the first time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig up -d

which will start MOTECH in the background

*                           SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE                               *
********************************************************************************
* 'fig up' ERASES ALL YOUR DATA (well not really all, but pretend it does)     *
* you have to run it at least once to setup MOTECH                             *
* if you run it again, it'll erase everything you did in MOTECH                *
* it's useful to start afresh, but remember: it nukes everything               *
********************************************************************************

If you ran setup_as_imp, Voila! MOTECH has started. Wait a little bit 
(about 30s) then direct your browser to:
http://localhost:8080/motech-platform-server
You can skip reading until the section named 'Stop MOTECH'.

*********************
*** dev only note ***
*********************
OK, I lied when I said above that MOTECH was up and running, but you're a dev 
and you know you first need to build and then copy the *.jar files and then 
deploy motech-platform-server.war file, right?

Once you start the containers with the fig up -d command above and _before_ you
build MOTECH for the first time, you need to copy the MOTECH binaries into the
container's /root/.motech/bundles directory.
Conveniently, the container's /root/.motech/bundles directory is exposed as
the docker-motech-bundles directory (with a-rw access) in your home directory.
[also note that the container's /root/.motech/config dir is also exposed as 
~/docker-motech-config] 
So, you can either manually copy the necessary binaries, or you can create a 
symbolic link to ~/docker-motech-bundles from ~/.motech/bundles.

Assuming the latter, and that you never built MOTECH before, you'd run the
following commands:

# go to your home dir
cd

# create the .motech dir
mkdir .motech

# create the symlink
ln -s ~/docker-motech-bundles .motech/bundles

[If you built MOTECH before, you can just delete the bundles directory and create
the symlink using the command above.]

Build MOTECH: see http://j.mp/1rkvpIf

Then Deploy & run MOTECH: see http://j.mp/1rgoscZ



Stop MOTECH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig stop




Restart MOTECH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type the following:

  fig start




Watching logs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
to watch all the logs (very verbose):

  fig logs

to watch only the tomcat logs:

  fig logs tomcat

see the sections in the generated fig.yml to see what other logs you can watch




Lastly
